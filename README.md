# Mock-Battle
## Description


This is just a simple mock rpg battle that I created in Python.

It simply gives you a setting that you are in a forest with the prompt of continuing or standing still untill you actually continue.

It  then rolls a chance of whether or not a goblin hops out of the bushes to attack, and then proceeds to go into a small battle, asking you to attack the goblin untill it is defeated, then the program ends

If it does not roll an encounter 3 time, the program ends as well.

### Installation

Requires the latest version python

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download and install the latest version of Python for your operating system

Once installed, download the Mock_Battle.py

Double click the Mock_Battle.py and the script should open in a python command prompt window
